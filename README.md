# SpotifySentimentAnalysis

## Inspiration
We knew that we wanted to incorporate the spotify API in some way, and searched for a way to connect this with data science and one of the hackathon tracts.

## What It Does
LyricVibe utilizes sentiment analysis to determine whether a user has "happy" or "sad" music taste, by analyzing lyrics of songs in their playlists.

## How We Built It
Taipy, Python, MongoDB Atlas, Spotify API

## Challenges
One challenge we had was learning how to properly use Taipy, as none of us had prior experience with it.

## Accomplishments
We are proud of [blank]

## What We Learned
We learned how to utilize Spoify's API, implement Taipy, and incorporate sentiment analysis.

## What's Next for LyricVibe

sample1_sentimentAnalyzer is used for language processing and sentiment analysis based on the generated dictionary. (input files: outputEmotions.csv)
