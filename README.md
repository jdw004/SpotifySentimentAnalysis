# SpotifySentimentAnalysis

## What It Does
At a high level, this product seeks to turn intangible, qualitative, subjective concept, like mood, or emotion, and with the might of the algorithm, convert it into a quantifiable metric from which we can song recommendations. Specifically, we have created an extensive natural language processing algorithm that seeks to derive the emotional sentiment attached to each word in the lyrics of a song, and assigns a happiness value to it, from which similar songs can be parsed and studied. Using this metric, we also attempt to study the average happiness of chart-topping songs in countries around the world, to see if there exist any tendencies towards certain countries having a preference towards sadder or happier music. Ultimately, the product is an attempt at tailoring music to a user's mood, which studies find to be beneficial for a number of reasons.
